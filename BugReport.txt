===================================BUGS===============================

1. I was having trouble simplifying the functions in the constructors,
   so i made a simplify function that i call inside of the def-integral
   function in the case that it returns the indefinite intefral.

2. Since I only simplify the indefinite integral there could be a
   performance issue when evaluating definite integrals because they
   are not simplified, although the hit on performance should be
   negligable.

3. The current implementation doesnt currently do nested simplification
   eg (+ (+ (* 1/2 (EXPT X 2)) (- (* 5 X) (* 1/2 (EXPT X 2)))) (LOG X))
   because the second (* 1/2 (EXPT X 2)) function is nested inside a
   subtraction function it is not simplified with the first occurance.
   This was not a requirement in the design specification but I thought
   it should be mentioned.
